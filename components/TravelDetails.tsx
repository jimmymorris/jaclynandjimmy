      <p>
        There are many ways to access downtown Washington, D.C., but below are all of the nearby
        major airports and train stations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most airline and travel websites will search all three airports when using the airport code{' '}
        <em>WAS</em>.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc mb-4 ml-4 pl-4">
        <li>
          <strong>DCA</strong>: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>IAD</strong>: Washington Dulles International Airport
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>BWI</strong>: Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amtrak</strong>: Union Station
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amtrak</strong>: Alexandria Station
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All airports and train stations are now accessible by public transportation, but rideshare
        services such as Uber and Lyft are great ways to navigate your way to downtown Washington,
        D.C. and Georgetown, specifically.
